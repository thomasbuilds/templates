## Troubleshooting

It appears that Webstorm generate some weird triggers when saving a file. In order to prevent that you can follow [this thread](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360000154544-I-m-having-a-huge-problem-with-Webstorm-and-react-hot-loader-) and disable the **"Safe Write"** option in **"Settings | Appearance & Behavior | System Settings"**.
